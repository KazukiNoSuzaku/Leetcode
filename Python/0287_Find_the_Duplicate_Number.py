# Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
# There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.
# You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
# Output: 2

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
# Output: 3

# Constraints:
# 1 <= n <= 10^5
# nums.length == n + 1
# 1 <= nums[i] <= n
# All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
